# Food Hygiene App - Establish Cleanliness

This project contains the code for an application I wrote during university that allows the users to check the food hygiene rating of all the registered establishments in the UK.

The application contains the following features: 

 * Seaching for establishments by name, filtering the results by distance, rating, the type of bussiness or region.
 * Sorting the results by distance, relevance, alphabetically and by rating.
 * Has a favourites system that allows the users to add and remove establishments from their favourites list, also displaying a quick summary for those in the home menu.

The video below will showcase all the functionality of the application as well as providing a glimpse into the look of the app:
